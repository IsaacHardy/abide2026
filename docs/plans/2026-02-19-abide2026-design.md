## Overview

Build 3 distinct static HTML + Tailwind CSS landing pages for the ABIDE 2026 Women's Conference. All 3 share the same visual identity, content, SEO, and accessibility standards. They differ only in layout, interactions, and design approach. The client will view all 3 and choose one to move forward with.

**Date:** July 31 – August 1, 2026
**Location:** Macon, GA
